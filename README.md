## The Challenge

The test for this app sometimes passes and sometimes fails. You should be able to quickly figure out a change that will make the test 100% reliable.

You may modify any file or files *except* those in the `src/` directory.


## Added timeout
Just added a timeout here for a specific element. Another solution can be to increase the default timeout of cypress commands in cypress.json, which is 4 seconds 
by default.
